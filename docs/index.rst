django-authtools
================

A custom user model app for Django 1.8+. It tries to stay true to the built-in
User model for the most part.  The main differences between authtools and
django.contrib.auth are a User model with email as username and classed-based
auth views.

It provides its own custom User model, views, urls, ModelAdmin, and Forms. The
Admin classes, views, and forms, however, are all User model agnostic, so they
will work with any User model.  django-authtools also provides base classes that
make creating your own custom User model easier.
