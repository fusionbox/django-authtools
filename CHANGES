0.2.0
-----

  - Django 1.6 support.

    Django 1.6 `broke backwards compatibility
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.6/#django-contrib-auth-password-reset-uses-base-64-encoding-of-user-pk>`_
    of the ``password_reset_confirm`` view. Be sure to update any references to
    this URL. Rather than using a separate view for each encoding, authtools uses
    :class:`a single view <authtools.views.PasswordResetConfirmView>` that works
    with both.

0.1.2 (released July 01, 2013)
------------------------------

  - Use ``prefetch_related`` in the :class:`~authtools.forms.UserChangeForm`
    to avoid doing hundreds of ``ContentType`` queries. The form from
    Django has the same feature, it wasn't copied over correctly in our
    original form.

0.1.1 (released May 30, 2013)
-----------------------------

* some bugfixes:

  - Call :meth:`UserManager.normalize_email` on an instance, not a class.
  - :class:`~authtools.models.User` should inherit its parent's ``Meta``.

0.1.0 (released May 28, 2013)
